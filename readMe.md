# NodePost



NodePost is a light backend-end logic for a blogpost website made with Node.js and Typescript. The application provides registeration and login routes where users are added to the MongoDB database and given an authentication token. The authorized user can then make a blogpost by providing a title and content. Other authorized users have the ability to comment on a given blogpost and search for users or blogposts. The user can also add blogposts to their favourite blogposts.
